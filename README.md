### What I Learned

- **React Fundamentals:** I gained a solid understanding of React, including components, state management, and routing, allowing me to build dynamic user interfaces.

- **Authentication and User Management:** I implemented user authentication using Supabase, ensuring secure access for hotel employees and learned to manage user profiles effectively.

- **Form Handling:** I became proficient in managing forms with React Hook Form, simplifying form validation, submission, and data handling.

- **Data Fetching and Caching:** React Query was employed to fetch and cache data, enhancing the performance and responsiveness of the application.

- **Real-time Updates:** I integrated real-time data updates using Supabase, enabling instant changes to cabin and booking data.

- **Responsive UI Design:** Styled Components were used to create responsive and visually appealing user interfaces that adapt to various screen sizes.

- **Toast Notifications:** React Hot Toast added user-friendly notifications for various actions within the app, improving the overall user experience.

- **Data Visualization:** Recharts was employed for creating charts and visual representations of vital statistics, aiding in data analysis and decision-making.

- **Routing and Navigation:** React Router facilitated smooth navigation and seamless transitions between different views and pages within the application.

- **Settings Management:** I learned to allow users to configure application-wide settings, such as breakfast pricing and booking constraints.

- **Higher-Order Components (HOC):** I utilized Higher-Order Components to enhance code reusability and share common functionalities among multiple components.

- **Compound Component Pattern:** I implemented the Compound Component Pattern to create cohesive and reusable component groups, improving the organization and maintainability of the code.

- **Dark Mode Implementation:** Dark mode was implemented to offer users a personalized visual experience and accommodate different preferences.

- **Git Version Control:** I practiced effective version control using Git, allowing for code management, and tracking project changes.

- **Project Planning and Management:** I gained experience in planning and managing a large-scale project, including feature development, bug fixing, and testing.

By building "The Wild Oasis" project with these technologies and concepts, I've developed a comprehensive set of skills and knowledge that can be applied to future projects and real-world scenarios. This experience has not only expanded my technical expertise but also improved my problem-solving capabilities.
